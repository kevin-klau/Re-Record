# Re-Cord
We've brought together computer vision and music education to create an interactive solo or social musical experience, offering real-time feedback on the player's recorder fingering technique. The Re-Recorder taps into the memories of our generation, where the recorder – a familiar plastic pipe from music classes and school concerts – holds a special place in our shared experiences.
